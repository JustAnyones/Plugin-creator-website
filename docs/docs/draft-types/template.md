# Template

Template drafts are special in a way that they provide implementations for other draft types.

You can define any attribute, even if it's not listed under the [attributes](#attributes) section
and any draft that uses the template draft as their template will inherit those values.

You can even reference other template drafts using the [template](#template) attribute.
