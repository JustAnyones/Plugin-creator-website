# Drafts

The term draft is used to refer to the game objects.

The game allows you to add or modify existing drafts with the plugin system.

Depending on the draft type chosen you can implement different features.

For instance, if you wanted to create a residential plugin with custom night lights,
you would need to use the [residential](residential.md) draft for the building itself
and reference the custom lights inside it as animations for which you would use the [animation](animation.md)
draft.
