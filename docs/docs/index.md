Welcome to the documentation page for TheoTown plugin system.

Using plugins you can add your own buildings to the game without modifying the apk (don't do the latter one, we really don't like it).
You may even share them with others, for example by using this the official forums or the plugin store.

If you're new to the plugin system and want to get started, check the [getting started](getting-started/writing-a-sample-plugin.md) topic.

If you're want to check the draft and attribute reference, see [here](draft-types/index.md).


This page is currently work-in-progress. In the future it will hold documentation for all draft types.
You are welcome to contribute [here](https://github.com/JustAnyones/Plugin-creator-website/tree/master/docs).

Some of the work left to do:

- [ ] Link to the documentation from PCA starting page
- [ ] Add links to specific attribute documentation from PCA
