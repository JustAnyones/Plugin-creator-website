# World texture

Here you can find major parts of the world texture. The naming scheme gives you a clue about where an image is placed in the world texture. That way you can reference to existing frames so that you can save plugin texture space by referencing them e.g. in animations.

!!! warning "The textures of premium content are not included, to obtain them personally reach out to the developers."
